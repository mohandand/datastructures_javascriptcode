Binary Tree:
        a
      /   \
     b     c
    / \     \
   d    e    f

->All alphabts are called nodes and arrows called edges.
-> a is root node as it has no parent 
-> d,e,f are leaf nodes as they dont have childrens
-> b is child of a node and parent of d and e node.
So a node can be a achild as well as parent based on its context.

->Rules ForBinary Tree:
   -> At most two childrens per nodes
   -> Exactly one root node
   -> Exatly one path between root node and any other node in Tree
   ->Empty tree also a binary tree

->Programaticaly Represenation
    ->Will Represenat tree as a object and every node treat as object and value and leftnode and rightnode 
       are the properties of node if they dont have left or right then we put as null.
