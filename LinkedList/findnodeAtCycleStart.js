//approach: two pointer (fast and slow pointer)
//it is linked list problem

//similar concept to detecting the cycle, 
//but after we find the cycle, as floyd says, 
//move back the slow pointer to the beginning 
//and then move slow and fast 1x speed, 
//whereever fast and slow meet then, will be beginning of the loop
