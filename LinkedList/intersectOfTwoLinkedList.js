//question: https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/

/* Explanation : what I'm doing is traversing the 1st linkedLists and while traversing multiplying each node value with -1 then again traversing 2nd list and when I get the first negative node value adding a pointer to it, next again traversing the 1st list and multiplying it with -1 again so that the structure of the list doesn't change and returning the pointer . (the pointer will be the head for the intersection)
Simple easy peasy */
